### Hierarchy & Font Size

To make your copy easier to understand and to emphasize different importance, sections or relationships you can work with different hierarchy levels.

Hierarchy levels can be:

Display
Headings
Overline
Body
Button Text
Links
Quotes

### Line Height & Letter Spacing

The best way to do this is to work with a multiple of four pixels and make the line height 8, 16 or 32 pixels larger, for example.

### Type Colors

Typographic color palette - Change, preview & test your palette for the entire typography hierarchy in one place
