Created by Danny Banks in 2017, [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) is a build system that allows you to generate styles for any platform from static design tokens in an agnostic format (e.g., JSON).

Why [Specify](https://github.com/Specifyapp/parsers/) and Style Dictionary make the perfect match

Specify is a Design API that helps you collect design data from Figma and distribute it in the right format, in the right project, at the right time, and to top it all: automatically.

Let’s focus on the “distribution” part. Like Style Dictionary, Specify helps you generate design data for any target platforms.

By default Specify returns design data in JSON but thanks its open source parsers you can transform your design data in any formats. I repeat, in any formats.
