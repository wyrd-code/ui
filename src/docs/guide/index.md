# WyrdUI

A carefuly crafted `Vue3` **User Interface Library** built using modern industry standards and best practices

## Styleguide

A style guide is a set of rules for how your brand should be displayed. This is both visual (design & imagery) as well as written content (voice & tone).

The purpose of a style guide is to allow multiple contributors to create content clearly that cohesively represents the brand. Almost every major brand has a style guide, though not all are public.

## Design System

A design system is a complete set of standards, documentation, and principles along with the components to achieve those standards. It is the marriage between your style guide and component library.

A design system should contain:

- **Guidelines**  - Instructions on how to design, use and achieve great UX
- **Branding**    - Assets and configuration restrictions that define your brand values & standards
- **Themes**      - Theme configurations for applying branding to the UI
- **Components**  - Building blocks for developing new products and features
- **Patterns**    - Utilities and helpers for achieving great UX when building components or using them

## Component Library

A component library is living, breathing implementation of your style guide. It's a shared set of UI components that developers can consume to build applications reflecting your brand. Some notable benefits:

- Having a component library means less custom code for consumers.
- Since there's a central location, you can ensure all components meet accessibility requirements.
- Components become more robust with multiple contributors submitting bug fixes and improvements in a single place.
- Less duplication of code allows you to ship new products and rewrite legacy code faster.
