- [W3C Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.3](https://w3c.github.io/aria)
  This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level markup.
