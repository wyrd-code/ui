##  Jakob Nielsen’s heuristics for interaction design

In 1990, Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich proposed ten guidelines to help develop UIs.

Nielsen’s heuristics are general principles, meaning that they do not determine specific usability rules. Instead, the heuristics are general rules of thumb you can follow to help create more accessible, user-friendly, and intuitive digital products.

They created these heuristics through observations and the expertise acquired during their years of work experience.

Here are the 10 Nielsen heuristics:

- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Help and documentation
